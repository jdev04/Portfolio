                        <p>This is the first site I made but never completed it. It was a place to
                            download custom songs for a rhythm game called MuseDash. It was made with plain html and css.
                            While it looks pretty good, it has some problems behind the scenes and needs a complete rewrite.
                            It was designed and written by another member of the community and I was making it for practice.

                            This is my second, first complete site I made for <span href="https://bpa.org">Business Professionals of America</span>
                            along with my partner that did the designing. We ended up placing first in regionals and 8th in state. Also made in plain html
                            and css with a little bit of javascript.

                            This site im currently working on is for the popular rhythm game called Friday Night Funkin.
                            It is a full stack site made with Next.js and the final product should allow for users to create accounts
                            to download and upload mods for the game. It is currently in development and will be released in the future.
